                Answer 01:- It tells the row to size itself automatically 
                    based on the size of the content inside it.

                Answer 02:- The row set to auto . 
                The row set to 100px will cut off content or overflow if
                 you put too much text in it.

                Answer 03:- yes rows can different heights 

                Answer 04:- If the row is auto it will keep growing until all the content fits.

                Answer 05:- Headder/Footer and Main Content
