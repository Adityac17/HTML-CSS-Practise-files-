ANSWERS TO THE QUESTION OF THE HOMEWORK OD 27TH JAN 2026 BY PROF. POONAM

1. Websites use responsive design to automatically rearrange content to fit the vastly different screen widths and pixel densities of each device.

2. It instructs the mobile browser to match the webpage width to the actual device width instead of zooming out to display a desktop-sized layout.

3.  Mobile browsers default to a wide desktop view (usually 980px) and shrink the entire page to fit the phone screen, making the text microscopic.

4. CSS uses @media queries to constantly measure the browser window's width and apply specific styles only when certain size conditions are met.

5.  The browser instantly switches which CSS rules are active, causing the layout to "snap" into a new structure (like changing from 3 columns to 1).

6. Layouts must adapt not just to screen size, but to the difference between precise mouse clicks on desktops and imprecise finger taps on touchscreens.

7. It stores the data in a dedicated file or database located on your computer's physical hard drive within the browser's user profile folder.

8.  Data persists because localStorage saves to the hard drive (disk), unlike JavaScript variables which live in temporary memory (RAM) and get wiped on reload.

9. Once the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files are downloaded, the code runs entirely on your local device's processor and does not need a server to function.

10. They save your status instantly to your browser's local storage and sync it to a central cloud database so your progress is saved across all devices.
